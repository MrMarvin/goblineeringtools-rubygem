== 1.2.0 ==
* Using lua (needs to be installed and in PATH, of course) to parse the
  savedVars. Creating a JSON structure of it (need "dkjson" LUA package
  installed. Google it, download it, put in in LUAs lib-dir).

== 1.1.0 ==
* The item ID is now parsed (in the case of random-enchantment items, the ID
  is parsed but the enchantment data is discarded) and emitted during CSV
  creation.

== 1.0.1 ==
* Worst QA engineer. Worst.

== 1.0.0 ==
* Incorrect files (incorrect is defined by the lack of the 
  'TradeSkillMaster_AccountingDB = {' line) are now detected and an exception 
  is raised.

== 0.9.0 ==
* I am the worst QA engineer in the entire world. Buyer and seller columns
  are now correct for purchase transactions.

== 0.8.0 ==
* Initial release. The TSM accounting saved variable file can be transmuted
  into a CSV. You can also access its contents in a nice (messy) datastructure.
