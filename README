== Installation ==
  $ gem install tsm-accounting

== Usage ==
  require 'tsm-accounting'
  tsm = TSMAccounting::Database.new(File.new('data/TradeSkillMaster_Accounting.lua').read)
  tsm.to_csv('/tmp/accounting.csv')

== Notes ==
The Transaction#usable_price() method outputs the price as a float. Copper >50 
is rounded up to 1s. If the transaction was worth less than 50c, you'll get 0.1
instead of 0.0.

If you need greater precision, price is the copper value of the transaction. It
is included in the CSV output.
