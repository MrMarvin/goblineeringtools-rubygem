== Installation ==
   # $ gem install tsm-accounting
   This release has known bugs so I wont create a gem of it.
   I builds however, so do it yourself.
   
   Known bugs: messed up special chars. If you know how to handle them corretly, please let me know!
   

== Usage ==
  require 'tsm-accounting'
  tsm = TSMAccounting::Database.new('data/TradeSkillMaster_Accounting.lua')
  tsm.to_csv('/tmp/accounting.csv')

== Notes ==
The Transaction#usable_price() method outputs the price as a float. Copper >50 
is rounded up to 1s. If the transaction was worth less than 50c, you'll get 0.1
instead of 0.0.

If you need greater precision, price is the copper value of the transaction. It
is included in the CSV output.
