== Installation ==
   # $ gem install goblineeringtools
   This release has known bugs so I wont create a gem of it.
   It builds however, so do it yourself.
   
   Known bugs: messed up special chars. If you know how to handle them corretly, please let me know!
   

== Usage ==
  require 'goblineeringtools'
  tsm = Goblineeringtools::TSMAccounting::Database.new('data/TradeSkillMaster_Accounting.lua')
  tsm.to_csv('/tmp/accounting.csv')
  
  or
  
  tsm.to_csv('./accounting_fewfields.csv',["Date","Time",'Item ID','Item Name','Price (g)','Buyer']) 
  
  to see all possible CSV fields:
  tsm.acceptable_fields


== Notes ==
The Transaction#usable_price() method outputs the price as a float. Copper >50 
is rounded up to 1s. If the transaction was worth less than 50c, you'll get 0.1
instead of 0.0.

If you need greater precision, price is the copper value of the transaction. It
is included in the CSV output.

== Thanks ==
OwlManAtt for the first version of this gem,
Sapu and all TSM devs for making TSM 
& The Consortium <http://consortium.stormspire.net/>.
